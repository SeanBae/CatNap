Using the realtime Firebase database, a back-end Python script, and an Arduino with two servomotors, CatNap introduces an completely automatized air mattress researvation system. The air mattress automatically inflates when the user sets the alarm, and then deflates at the end of the pre-specified time. CatNap also adds social element to your nap expereince by sending "Yo" to all of your friends at the end of your nap.
